ðŸ”¹ 1. Primitive Data Types
These are the basic building blocks. There are 8 primitive types in Java:

Data Type	Size	Default Value	Range
byte	1 byte (8-bit)	0	-128 to 127
short	2 bytes (16-bit)	0	-32,768 to 32,767
int	4 bytes (32-bit)	0	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	8 bytes (64-bit)	0L	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	4 bytes (32-bit)	0.0f	~7 decimal digits precision
double	8 bytes (64-bit)	0.0d	~15 decimal digits precision
char	2 bytes (16-bit, Unicode)	'\u0000'	0 to 65,535 (Unicode characters)
boolean	1 bit (size depends on JVM)	false	true / false


ðŸ”¹ 2. Non-Primitive (Reference/Object) Data Types
These are objects that reference memory locations. They store addresses, not actual values.

String (sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello")
Arrays (collection of elements, e.g., int[] nums = {1,2,3};)
Classes (user-defined types)
Interfaces
Enums

Type	     Also Called	   Conversion	         Data Loss?	       Example
Automatic	 Widening	       Smaller â†’ Larger	   No	               int â†’ double
Manual	   Narrowing	     Larger â†’ Smaller  	 Yes (possible)	   double â†’ int
