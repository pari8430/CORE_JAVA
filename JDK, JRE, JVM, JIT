1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) : 
Think of JVM as the engine that runs Java programs.
It takes your .class file (bytecode) and executes it on your computer.
It makes Java platform independent (same code runs on Windows, Linux, Mac).
ðŸ‘‰ Example: JVM is like a translator who reads Java's universal language (bytecode) and speaks in the local language of your computer (machine code).

2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) : 
JRE = JVM + libraries + files needed to run Java programs.
If you only want to run Java programs (not write them), you just need JRE.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: JRE is like a kitchen that has the cooking stove (JVM) + utensils + ingredients (libraries). You can cook (run programs) here.

3. JDK (Java Development Kit) : 
JDK = JRE + development tools (compiler javac, debugger, etc.).
Needed if you want to write and develop Java programs.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: JDK is like a restaurant kitchen for chefs â€“ it has everything from JRE (so you can cook) + extra tools to create new dishes (write programs).

4. JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler) : 
Part of JVM.
It speeds up execution by converting frequently used bytecode into machine code at runtime (instead of interpreting line by line).
ðŸ‘‰ Example: If you keep translating the same sentence again and again, JIT says: "Wait, let me remember this in your language so I donâ€™t have to translate it every time." ðŸš€

âœ… In short:
JDK = For writing + running programs.
JRE = For running programs.
JVM = The engine that executes Java bytecode.
JIT = JVMâ€™s helper that makes programs run faster.
